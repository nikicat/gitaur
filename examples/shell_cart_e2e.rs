//! End-to-end driver for the interactive shell's cart → approve → apply flow
//! (REPL phase 3), used by `tests/container/extended/07_shell_cart_apply.sh`.
//!
//! The shell only runs interactively (stdin must be a TTY), so this spawns the
//! real no-arg `gaur` under a PTY (via the shared [`pty_harness::Pty`]) and
//! scripts the staged-transaction flow against the `test-trivial` AUR fixture:
//!
//! ```text
//!   add test-trivial        → staged, needs review (cart reprinted)
//!   apply                   → refused: the approval gate blocks it
//!   approve test-trivial    → cleared without opening a diff
//!   apply                   → transaction confirm, build, then the sudo gate
//!   show                    → "cart is empty" — the clean apply emptied it
//! ```
//!
//! Each step both drives the shell and asserts the line it should print. The
//! `.sh` runs `gaur -Sy` first so the shell's on-disk index can classify
//! `test-trivial` as AUR (the shell does not fetch at startup), and asserts the
//! package is actually installed once this driver exits clean.
