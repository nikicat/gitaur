# aurox architecture

This is a maintainer's map of how `aurox` is wired. For user-facing flags
see `README.md`; for the test suite see `docs/TESTING.md`; for profiling
see `docs/PROFILING.md`.

## The 30-second tour

`aurox` is a pacman-compatible CLI that resolves and builds AUR packages
against a local clone of [`github.com/archlinux/aur`](https://github.com/archlinux/aur)
— a single bare repo where every package is its own `refs/heads/<pkgbase>`
branch (~154 k of them, ~2 GiB pack). Three big moving parts:

1. **The mirror** (`src/mirror/`) — bare clone on disk, refreshed via
   incremental gix fetches. `~/.local/state/aurox/aur`.
2. **The index** (`src/index/`) — rkyv-archived blob mapping pkgname →
   pkgbase + deps + provides + version. One file, mmapped at load.
   `~/.local/state/aurox/index.bin`.
3. **The build pipeline** (`src/build/`) — resolves a `-S` target list
   into a `Plan`, drives `makepkg` per pkgbase in stratified order, then
   `pacman -U`'s the results.

Anything pacman owns (`-Q`, `-R`, `-T`, `-D`, `-F`, `-U`, `-Su` system
upgrades, and the `pacman.conf` it reads) is forwarded verbatim. `aurox`
owns `-S <pkg>` (install), `-Sy` (mirror refresh), `-Ss`/`-Si` (search/info),
and `-Sc` (clean). AUR upgrades are the interactive shell's job (`aurox` →
`upgrade`), not the `-Syu` flag — that's a plain `pacman -Syu` passthrough.

## Module map

Each parent module is a `<name>.rs` file (not `<name>/mod.rs`) sitting
next to its `<name>/` submodule directory — the Rust-2018 path layout.

```

## Key design choices

### Why two phases of dep resolution (cycle check + strata)?

`topo::sort` runs over the **full** dep graph (depends + makedepends +
checkdepends) purely to reject cycles — even a cycle through plain runtime
`depends` is unbuildable. `topo::strata` then runs over **makedepends +
checkdepends only**: those are the build-time constraints that decide
when a pkg's makepkg is allowed to run. Runtime `depends` get resolved
together at the eventual `pacman -U`, which is allowed to satisfy intra-
batch deps. The split is what lets siblings in the same stratum build
without one needing the other installed first.

### Why a precomputed `PacmanIndex`?

`alpm::Alpm` is `Send` but not `Sync`. It wraps a C handle that isn't
thread-safe. Anything that wants to classify deps in parallel — and we
do via rayon — can't share `&Alpm`. So `PacmanIndex::build(&Alpm)`
snapshots the local + sync DBs into owned `HashMap`/`HashSet` once;
classification then becomes pure data, parallelisable, and cheap.

### Resolving the installed counterpart of an AUR entry

> Code: `PacmanIndex::counterpart` (`src/pacman/alpm_db.rs`), consumed by
> `prepare_one` (`src/build.rs`) and rendered by `review::header`
> (`src/build/review.rs`).

When `aurox` is about to build an AUR pkgbase it needs to answer one
question: **what does the user currently have installed that this build will
displace?** The label on the review screen ("install" / "reinstall" /
"upgrade"), the choice of a diff base for the PKGBUILD review, and the
fallback note all hinge on it. There are four independent pacman/AUR
mechanisms by which a build can displace an installed pkg, and conflating
them produced [the dotnet-runtime regression](#dotnet-runtime-case): a
provides-substitution upgrade was rendered as a fresh install with no diff.
The fix is one helper that classifies the answer by provenance.

#### Provenance hierarchy

`PacmanIndex::counterpart(entry)` walks the entry in priority order and
returns the first hit, tagged with how it matched:

| Priority | Source                            | Provenance | Why this rank                                                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | `entry.pkgnames[*].name`          | `Pkgname`  | The literal "is the thing I'm building already installed under that name?". Canonical pkgs and split-pkg siblings (Bisq shape) both land here. |
| 2        | `entry.replaces[*]`               | `Replaces` | An explicit "this build supersedes that pkg" declared by the maintainer. Strongest rename signal short of an actual pkgname match. |
| 3a       | `entry.pkgnames[*].provides[*]`   | `Provides` | Pkgname-scoped: the providing-pkgname is what `provides=X` is attached to. More specific than pkgbase-level. |
| 3b       | `entry.provides[*]`               | `Provides` | Pkgbase-level provides (declared before any `pkgname = …` in `.SRCINFO`) — applies to every pkgname implicitly. |

Within each tier the first hit in declaration order wins, so the choice is
deterministic across runs (`Vec` ordering is stable). Versioned names like
`provides = libfoo=1.2` go through `strip_version_constraint` before
lookup; the version on the returned struct is **always** the localdb
version of the matched pkgname, never the virtual version baked into the
suffix. `None` means no match → fresh install.

Why `Pkgname > Replaces > Provides`:

- A canonical match (the pkg I'm building is already in your localdb)
  trumps any rename signal, even one the maintainer explicitly declared.
  This is the load-bearing case for partial-split reinstalls — if the
  maintainer left a stale `replaces=` of the pkgname they still ship, we
  must not classify that as a rename.
- `Replaces` is an explicit declaration; `Provides` is an implicit
  transition. When both could match the same legacy pkg, the explicit
  declaration is the one we cite.
- Scoped provides (3a) beats pkgbase-level (3b) for the same reason:
  attribution to a specific pkgname is more informative than a top-level
  blanket.

#### Header labelling

`review::header(pkgbase, new_ver, counterpart)` is a pure function
deriving the screen label from the counterpart. The `[…]` annotation
fires exactly when the user's installed pkgname differs from the pkgbase
being built — that's when the reader needs to know "this is a transition,
not an upgrade of literally the thing you have installed."

| `counterpart`                                  | Header                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `None`                                         | `install: {pkgbase} {new}`                                        |
| `Some(via=Pkgname, ver==new)`                  | `reinstall: {pkgbase} {new}`                                      |
| `Some(via=Pkgname)`                            | `upgrade: {pkgbase} {ver} → {new}`                                |
| `Some(via=Replaces)`                           | `upgrade: {pkgbase} {ver} → {new}  [replaces {name}]`             |
| `Some(via=Provides, name==pkgbase)`            | `upgrade: {pkgbase} {ver} → {new}`                                |
| `Some(via=Provides)`                           | `upgrade: {pkgbase} {ver} → {new}  [provides {name}]`             |

"Reinstall" is reserved for `Pkgname` matches. A `Provides` / `Replaces`
match with coincidentally-equal versions is still a transition between
two different installed identities, not a reinstall, and `upgrade_base_version`
keeps trying the history walk for those cases — `find_installed_commit`'s
fallback to full PKGBUILD is the right outcome if the walk misses, but
mislabelling it "reinstall" up front hides what's happening.

#### Diff base + fallback note

`find_installed_commit` walks the new pkgbase's bare-mirror branch
looking for a commit whose `.SRCINFO` declared `counterpart.version`,
bounded by `MAX_HISTORY_SCAN = 64`. Three outcomes:

| Scenario                                                                                  | Walk result | What the user sees                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Canonical / split: same pkgbase lineage as the installed pkg                              | Match       | Real diff against the historic SRCINFO commit.  |
| Pkgname rename inside the same pkgbase (SRCINFO still has the matching `pkgver-pkgrel`)   | Match       | Real diff — the rename itself shows up in it.   |
| AUR pkgbase rename or provides transition (different mirror branch entirely — case B)     | Miss        | `fallback_note` (provenance-aware) → full PKGBUILD. |
| Stale install older than `MAX_HISTORY_SCAN` commits, or VCS pkgbase whose pkgver is dynamic | Miss        | Same fallback, but the note mentions the bound. |

The fallback note is phrased by provenance:

- `Pkgname` miss → "no AUR commit in the last 64 of `{pkgbase}` matches
  installed `{pkgname}` (`{ver}`)" — bounded walk, *might* be too short.
- `Replaces` / `Provides` miss → "no AUR commit of `{pkgbase}` produced
  installed `{pkgname}` (`{ver}`)" — explicitly *not* about the bound;
  it's a lineage mismatch. The history of `dotnet-core-7.0-bin` was
  never going to produce a `dotnet-runtime-7.0-*` artifact, and the
  message says so.

#### Worked examples

**Canonical upgrade.** User has `neovim 0.10.0-1`. AUR pkgbase `neovim` is
at `0.10.1-1`.

```
counterpart = Pkgname(neovim, 0.10.0-1)
header      = "upgrade: neovim 0.10.0-1 → 0.10.1-1"
walk        = match (same branch, same pkgver in older commit) → diff
```

**Split pkgbase, one sibling installed.** User has `bisq-cli 2.0-1`.
Pkgbase `bisq` produces `bisq-cli`, `bisq-daemon`, `bisq-desktop` at
`2.1-1`; `bisq-desktop` declares `provides = bisq` (scoped).

```
counterpart = Pkgname(bisq-cli, 2.0-1)        // Pkgname beats Provides
header      = "upgrade: bisq 2.0-1 → 2.1-1"   // no [...] annotation
walk        = match → diff against last bisq-cli SRCINFO of 2.0-1
```

<a name="dotnet-runtime-case"></a>**Provides rename across pkgbases (the
dotnet case).** User has `dotnet-runtime-7.0 7.0.15-1` from an old AUR
pkgbase that no longer exists. The current AUR pkgbase
`dotnet-core-7.0-bin` produces pkgname `dotnet-core-7.0-bin` declaring
`provides = dotnet-runtime-7.0`.

```
counterpart = Provides(dotnet-runtime-7.0, 7.0.15-1)
header      = "upgrade: dotnet-core-7.0-bin 7.0.15-1 → 7.0.20.sdk410-2  [provides dotnet-runtime-7.0]"
walk        = miss (different lineage)
            → note: "no AUR commit of dotnet-core-7.0-bin produced installed dotnet-runtime-7.0 (7.0.15-1); showing full PKGBUILD"
            → full PKGBUILD shown
```

Before the counterpart helper landed, this scenario rendered as
`install: dotnet-core-7.0-bin 7.0.20.sdk410-2` with the full PKGBUILD and
no upgrade context — leaving the user to guess whether they were doing a
fresh install or an upgrade.

**Explicit `replaces=`.** Maintainer renamed a pkg and declared
`replaces=old-foo` in the new PKGBUILD. User still has `old-foo`.

```
counterpart = Replaces(old-foo, 0.9-1)
header      = "upgrade: foo-ng 0.9-1 → 1.0-1  [replaces old-foo]"
walk        = miss (different pkgbase) → fallback note + full PKGBUILD
```

**Transitional state — user has both old and new.** Happens when the
old pkg lacked `replaces=` so pacman didn't auto-remove it.

```
localdb     = { foo-ng@2.0-1, old-foo@0.9-1 }
counterpart = Pkgname(foo-ng, 2.0-1)          // Pkgname wins over Replaces/Provides
header      = "upgrade: foo-ng 2.0-1 → 2.1-1"
walk        = match → diff
```

#### What this design deliberately does not change

- **Picker label** (`-Syu`): keeps showing the foreign pkgname
  (`dotnet-runtime-7.0`) — that's the name the user typed `pacman -Q`
  to see. The counterpart provenance is a review-time concern.
- **`pacman -U`'s removal behaviour**: owned by the PKGBUILD's
  `replaces=` declaration. Aurox hands pacman the files; pacman's own
  rules govern whether the old pkg comes out.
- **Idempotency check** in `prepare_one`: keys on
  `entry.pkgnames × new_ver` against the on-disk `.pkg.tar.zst` set.
  That's a build-artifact question, not an installed-state question,
  and stays as-is.
- **Schema bump**: `entry.replaces` is already in v2; per-pkgname
  `replaces` doesn't exist but isn't needed — AUR maintainers
  overwhelmingly declare `replaces` at the pkgbase level.

#### Counterpart hint — disambiguating multi-provides pkgbases

The unhinted walk above picks the **first declared** match within each
tier. That's good enough for pkgname / replaces tiers (a split pkgbase
with multiple installed siblings labels identically with any of them).
The Provides tier breaks down when a pkgbase declares several
`provides=` virtuals and the user has more than one installed.

> Code: `Target` (`src/build.rs`), `ExpandedTargets::counterpart_hints`
> (`src/resolver/pkgbase_expand.rs`), `Plan::counterpart_hints`
> (`src/resolver.rs`), `PacmanIndex::counterpart_with_hint`
> (`src/pacman/alpm_db.rs`).

`aurox::build::Target` pairs each input with an optional
`hint: Option<PkgName>` — the pkgname the user thinks they have
installed. Two sources populate it:

| Source       | Hint                                                                 |

| shell `upgrade` | `Some(PkgUpgrade.name)` — the foreign pkgname that triggered the upgrade (`CartItem::from_upgrade`) |

`expand_pkgbase_targets` records `hints[pkgbase] = hint_or_inferred`
whenever it rewrites a target via the pkgname or provides path
(bare-pkgbase inputs without an explicit hint stay unhinted because the
user didn't name a pkgname). `prepare_one` reads
`plan.counterpart_hints[pkgbase]` and forwards it to
`PacmanIndex::counterpart_with_hint`.

`counterpart_with_hint` first probes the entry for the hinted pkgname:
if it matches a pkgname / replaces / provides line *and* is installed,
that's the counterpart with the appropriate provenance. Otherwise it
falls back to the unhinted walk — so a stale or unmatched hint doesn't
silently nullify a real counterpart.

#### Worked example: `dotnet-runtime-7.0` regression

```
AUR pkgbase = dotnet-core-7.0-bin
  provides  = aspnet-runtime, dotnet-runtime-7.0   # declaration order
localdb     = { aspnet-runtime@10.0-1, dotnet-runtime-7.0@7.0.20-1 }
-Syu row    = PkgUpgrade { name: "dotnet-runtime-7.0", … }
```

Without a hint, the unhinted walk picks `aspnet-runtime` (first
declared) — the screen shows "install: dotnet-core-7.0-bin 7.0.20.sdk410-2"
with no diff, because the new pkgbase's history doesn't carry a commit
matching aspnet-runtime's 10.0-1.

With the hint plumbed through:

```
Target { spec: "dotnet-runtime-7.0", hint: Some("dotnet-runtime-7.0") }
→ expand sees provides hit, records hints["dotnet-core-7.0-bin"] = "dotnet-runtime-7.0"
→ prepare_one: counterpart_with_hint(entry, Some("dotnet-runtime-7.0"))
→ counterpart_for_hint: dotnet-runtime-7.0 installed + entry provides it → match
→ header = "upgrade: dotnet-core-7.0-bin 7.0.20-1 → 7.0.20.sdk410-2  [provides dotnet-runtime-7.0]"
→ walk = matches commit on the new pkgbase → real diff
```

#### Ambiguity diagnostics

`counterpart_with_hint` emits two `tracing::warn!` diagnostics that
make future bugs of this shape visible in the trace:

- **`hint diverged from unhinted lookup`** — the hint changed which
  pkgname the call returned. Useful as a check that the hint plumbing
  is doing what it should without changing behaviour invisibly.
- **`multiple installed pkgs match this pkgbase's provides; picking
  the first declared`** — fired from the unhinted walk when the
  Provides tier has 2+ installed candidates. Always shows the picked
  pkgname and the alternatives so the user can spot the dotnet-runtime
  shape even outside the shell's `upgrade` flow.

Neither warning changes behaviour: the picked counterpart is unchanged.
They exist so the trace tells the truth about a heuristic-driven choice.

#### Resolution case matrix

The provenance hierarchy + header table + hint plumbing above are the
mechanics; the matrix below is the *enumeration* — every distinct shape
`(user's localdb state, new pkgbase's declarations)` the resolver routes,
the provenance it returns, the review header it produces, and which test
(if any) pins the cell. New behaviour belongs in a new row; new tests
fill the "Smoke" column.

Notation:
- `P` is the new AUR pkgbase being built. `Q` is one of its pkgnames.
- `X`, `Y`, `V` are pkgnames the user has installed; `v_old < v_new`.
- *foreign* = in pacman's localdb but absent from every sync DB. Models
  the dotnet-runtime case (installed via a prior source no longer shipping
  the pkg).
- *canonical* = installed via aurox, so its pkgbase is in the AUR mirror
  and pkgname = the canonical AUR name.
- "—" in Smoke would mean correct in code (unit-tested in
  `alpm_db::tests` and `resolver::pkgbase_expand::tests`) but no
  end-to-end fixture yet. Every row had a Smoke entry; when adding new
  behaviour, keep it that way.
- `†` marks a row whose smoke test drove the old `-Syu` *flag* upgrade path,
  which is now a plain `pacman -Syu` passthrough — the behaviour moved to the
  shell's `upgrade`, and its e2e coverage is pending a shell-flow (PTY) port.
  The underlying logic stays unit-tested.

Rules the matrix encodes:

- **Pkgname > Replaces > Provides**. Case 11 is the load-bearing guard
  on Pkgname-vs-Replaces: a maintainer's stale `replaces=` of a pkgname
  they still ship must not hide the literal Pkgname match (would
  otherwise mislabel an upgrade as a rename and chase the wrong
  history).
- **Scoped Provides > pkgbase-level Provides** within the Provides tier
  (3a > 3b in the priority table). Lets the matrix collapse split-pkg
  scoped provides (case 12) and pkgbase-level provides (cases 6, 7, 9)
  to the same `via=Provides` provenance without losing attribution.
- **Hint overrides declaration order in Provides, never overrides a
  higher-tier match**. A stale or unmatched hint falls back to the
  unhinted walk — it cannot null a real Pkgname / Replaces win.
- **Same version is "reinstall" only for Pkgname provenance** (case 2).
  Same version under Replaces / Provides is still a cross-identity
  upgrade transition and shows as `upgrade:` plus the `[…]` annotation.
- **The shell's `upgrade` is the only place a hint comes from outside the
  spec string** (case 8b): each `PkgUpgrade` carries `name`, which
  `CartItem::from_upgrade` wraps as `Target::with_hint(spec, name)`. (The
  retired `-Syu` flag picker used to be this source; the flag is now a plain
  `pacman -Syu` passthrough.)

The matrix is intentionally scoped to *counterpart resolution* (the
`prepare_one` → `counterpart_with_hint` decision). Sibling concerns like
expand-side pkgbase pinning when a pkgname collides across two pkgbases
(test 25) and the pacman-fast-path that bypasses AUR entirely for
sync-repo names (test 11) live one layer up in the resolver and don't
change the cells above.

#### Install-side selection: which siblings reach `pacman -U`

A split PKGBUILD always packages every pkgname (makepkg has no
`--pkg=` equivalent to "build only this one"). What gets *installed*
is a separate decision, made by `Plan.pkgname_selections` and applied
by `select_outputs` (`src/build.rs`) right before `install_stratum`
hands files to `pacman -U`. The contract is "pkgbase absent ⇒ install
every built pkgname; pkgbase present ⇒ install only the listed subset
+ their intra-split runtime deps."

`expand_pkgbase_targets` is the single writer of that map. Three
branches feed it:

| Input shape                                         | Branch                            | Selection recorded?                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `-S X` where X is a pkgname of split P              | by_name rewrite                   | yes — `[X]` + sibling runtime deps         |
| `-S V` where V is a scoped `provides` of split P    | by_provides rewrite               | yes (when scoped) — `[provider] + deps`    |
| `-S V` where V is a pkgbase-level `provides`        | by_provides rewrite               | no (every sibling provides V implicitly)   |
| `-S P` bare pkgbase                                 | by_pkgbase fallback               | yes (only when user picks a true subset)   |
| `-Syu` row → spec is foreign-installed pkgname X    | **pacman shortcut**               | yes — same `[X]` + deps as by_name rewrite |
| `-S X` where X is also in a sync repo               | pacman shortcut                   | yes when X is also an AUR split pkgname    |

The pacman-shortcut row was the regression target for the
google-cloud-cli-bq bug (old smoke 44, retired with the `-Syu` flag's
upgrade path — the scenario is reached via the shell's `upgrade` now, and
its e2e port is pending). The `pac.is_installed(bare) || pac.in_sync(bare)`
short-circuit was originally a pure "let pacman handle this" lane, but
it also fires for foreign-installed pkgnames that happen to be siblings
of an AUR split pkgbase. Without recording the selection there too,
`install_stratum` had no filter and `pacman -U`'d every sibling
makepkg packaged from the same PKGBUILD. Twin to the
`record_target_hint` fix (whose old regression was smoke 33): both
bookkeeping passes (hint, selection) must run on the shortcut path, not
only on the rewrite path.

`select_outputs` enforces the selection by `(pkgname, version)` rather
than pkgname alone. The version gate also kills a separate hazard:
when a previous build left `.pkg.tar.{zst,xz}` files for an older
`pkgver-pkgrel` in the same worktree, `find_produced` returns every
historic artifact and a name-only filter would feed both versions into
one `pacman -U`. Pinning the filter to `entry.version()` keeps the
install transaction at exactly one file per required pkgname.

### Why per-worker `gix::Repository` clones in `full_build`?

`gix::Repository` is `Send` but **not** `Sync` — it carries interior
`RefCell`s for object / pack / zlib caches. So the rayon workers in
`index::build::full_build` can't share a single `&mirror.repo`. The
pattern is `par_iter().map_init(|| repo.clone(), op)`: each worker
thread takes one cheap structural clone (shares the underlying `Arc`'d
object DB + refs; only the per-thread caches are fresh) and reuses it
across every branch it pulls. A `Mutex` wraps the seed clone so the
`map_init` init closure (which must be `Sync`) can pull a fresh handle
without capturing `&Repository`. Lock contention is bounded by
`cfg.index_threads` because init runs once per worker thread, not per
branch.

What you must **not** do: `gix::open(&path)` inside the worker closure.
Reopening reparses config + rescans refs + rediscovers alternates per
branch and dominates wall time (observed: ~2.2 ms/branch ⇒ 5+ minutes
on the 150 k-branch AUR mirror). Two regression tests guard this:

- `tests/build_worker_shares_repo.rs` asserts the `WORKER_REPO_OPENS`
  counter in `index::build` stays at zero; bump it from any future
  worker-side `gix::open` so the counter test catches the regression.
- `tests/full_build_rusage.rs` is a black-box check: builds a realistic
  5 k-branch mirror (`git fast-import` + `git repack -ad` + `git pack-refs`)
  and asserts `getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF).ru_minflt` stays under 20 k for the
  `full_build` call. The bug-vs-fix ratio is ~13× (38 k vs 3 k) — wide
  enough to survive CI drift. Linux-gated.

### Why `makepkg -d` (skip dep checks) instead of `-s`?

`makepkg -s` tries to install missing deps via `pacman -S`, which can
only fetch from sync repos. For AUR-only deps the fetch fails — `pacman`
doesn't know about them. So aurox:

1. Pre-installs all **repo** deps (direct + transitive) via `pacman -S`.
2. Pre-installs all **AUR makedeps + checkdeps** stratum-by-stratum via
   `pacman -U` after each stratum's builds.
3. Tells `makepkg` to skip its own checks (`-d`).

Runtime `depends` are satisfied later by the same stratum's `pacman -U`
resolving intra-batch.

### Why one big `IndexFile` blob instead of a SQLite catalog?

Search-and-info workloads are 100 % scan-the-whole-thing. `rkyv` lets us
mmap the on-disk blob and dereference fields with zero copies; `rayon`
parallelises the regex scan across ~154 k entries trivially. A SQLite
catalog would force per-row deserialization and per-query index lookups
that don't help when most queries are regex over `pkgname` + `pkgdesc`.

The catalog is rebuilt incrementally — `index::update::incremental_update`
applies the `RefUpdate` deltas produced by `mirror::fetch::incremental_fetch`,
so a `aurox -Sy` doesn't re-parse the 99 % of pkgbases that didn't move.

### Why no build state DB — idempotency keys on the artifact filename

There is deliberately **no** sidecar "what did we build" database. A
pkgbase counts as already-built when its worktree holds a
`.pkg.tar.{zst,xz}` named at the AUR index's exact `[epoch:]pkgver-pkgrel`
for *every* required pkgname; `prepare_one` (`src/build.rs`) makes that
check via `install::find_produced` + `install::matches_pkg` and returns
`Disposition::Cached`, skipping `makepkg`. The artifact filename
(`<pkgname>-<version>-<arch>.pkg.tar.zst`) *is* the cache key, so a
declined `pacman -U` or interrupted install just replays the install step
with no rebuild. VCS pkgbases never hit this cache — their static
`pkgver` differs from the dynamic one `pkgver()` writes into the filename
— so `-git`/`-svn`/etc. always rebuild, which is correct.

`build::artifacts_built` is a read-only mirror of the same check, used by
the shell's change-set preview to flag rows whose build is already done
(see `src/cli/shell/upgrade.rs`). Keeping idempotency derived
from on-disk artifacts rather than a stored `last_built_commit` follows
the "minimize persisted state" rule: nothing is recorded that the
artifacts themselves don't already say.

The one thing that genuinely *can't* be derived from a pacman DB or an
artifact — per-pkgbase **build duration** — is the sole persisted build
metric, in `metrics.db` (`src/build/metrics.rs`, `rusqlite`). It is a
cost-visibility hint for the change-set preview, never a gate on what gets built.

### Why gix instead of libgit2 / shelling out to `git`?

- libgit2 HTTP is ~100× slower than the git CLI on the AUR mirror's pack
  (see `memory/project_libgit2_http_slow.md` style of finding).
- Subprocess `git` is fine for clone/fetch but doesn't let us hook
  progress / per-ref deltas the way we want for the UI.

So gix for fetch + index walks (pure Rust, no subprocess), with two
specific quirks worth knowing:

1. `gix::prepare_clone_bare` defaults to a non-bare refspec
   (`+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*`). We override via
   `replace_refspecs` so refs land under `refs/heads/*` — see
   `tests/clone_refs_layout.rs` for the regression test.
2. Bootstrap clone over HTTPS to `github.com` is slow at the negotiation
   stage; relies on PRs #2604/#2605 against gitoxide.

### Argv parsing — why both clap AND PacFlags?

Pacman accepts flags freely on either side of the operation
(`pacman --noconfirm -S foo` and `pacman -S --noconfirm foo` both work).
clap with `trailing_var_arg + allow_hyphen_values` is needed so flags
unknown to aurox (e.g. pacman's `-Rns`) don't trip clap. The cost: any
flag after `-S` lands in the trailing var arg and never reaches
`cli.noconfirm`. `cli/flags.rs` re-parses argv into `PacFlags`; `dispatch`
ORs the two sources together. If you add a new global flag, you'll need
to plumb it through both.

## Common gotchas for new maintainers

- **`alpm` mutability**: do NOT hold `&Alpm` across rayon workers; build
  a `PacmanIndex` first.
- **`gix::Repository` is `Send` but not `Sync`**: parallel workers must
  hold their own clone (see `full_build` and its `WORKER_REPO_OPENS`
  regression seam). Never `gix::open` inside a per-branch worker closure.
- **`gix` refs under `refs/remotes/origin/*`**: only the bootstrap clone
  is affected (see custom refspec in `clone.rs`). Subsequent fetches
  write to `refs/heads/*` because that's what the bare config records.
- **makepkg refuses to run as root**: the build worktree must be owned
  by a non-root user. In CI / containers this means an unprivileged
  `builder` user with passwordless sudo for the pacman calls.
- **Sudo is consolidated, not cached by aurox**: we don't run
  `sudo -v` keepalives. We assume the OS sudo cache (5-15 min) bridges
  the per-stratum prompts.
- **Don't add `aur_order: Vec<String>`**: it was replaced by
  `aur_strata: Vec<Vec<String>>`. Use `plan.aur_order()` for a flat
  view; the strata structure is load-bearing for the build pipeline.
